# RANDOM GAMES
This repository contains some simple  games I have created as I brush up on my coding in the programming languages I know.
This is also a way for me to create beginner programs/games in new languages that I'm trying out

So far, I have created:
## Python:
- Rock, paper, scissors

## Javascript:
- Madlibs generator
- Digital Clock
