# Beginner Programs
This repository contains some simple  games I have created as I brush up on my coding in the programming languages I know.
This is also a way for me to create beginner programs/games in new languages that I'm trying out. 

So far, I have created:
## Python:
- [Rock, Paper, Scissors](./rockpaperscissors)
- A Translation program (107 languages)
- An Instagram Bot 

## Javascript:
- Madlibs generator (5 options)
- Digital Clock
- African Countries Guessing Game
