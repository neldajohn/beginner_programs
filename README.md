# Beginner Programs
This repository contains some simple  games I have created as I brush up on my coding in the programming languages I know.
This is also a way for me to create beginner programs/games in new languages that I'm trying out. 

So far, I have created:
## Python:
- [Rock, Paper, Scissors](./rockpaperscissors)
- [A Translation program (107 languages)](./translate)
- [An Instagram Bot](./instabot)
- [Dice Rolling](./diceroll)

## Javascript:
- [Madlibs Generator](./madlibs)
- [Digital Clock](./clock)
- [African Countries Guessing Game](./africa)
